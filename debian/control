 RIME is the acronym of Rime Input Method Engine.

 RIME is a lightweight, extensible input method engine supporting various input
 schematas including glyph-based input methods, romanization-based input methods

 and sentences intelligently and provide very accurate traditional Chinese

 consistently on different platforms with OS-specific wrappers.
